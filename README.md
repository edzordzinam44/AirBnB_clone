# Project Description -
    An Airbnb clone project involves developing a web or mobile application that provides a platform for users to list and book accommodations, similar to the Airbnb platform. This can include features for property owners to list their spaces, travelers to search for and book accommodations, and an admin dashboard to manage listings and user accounts.
# Command Interpreter -
    A command interpreter, often referred to as a shell or command-line interpreter, is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer or software application by entering commands. It reads user input, interprets the commands, and executes them on the operating system or application.
